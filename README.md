        This script will help you collect information on all the Civilian and Military Aircraft ever made,
        sourced from Wikipedia. The information is essentially in the form of profiles including categories
        such as Manufacturer, Country of Origin, Usage, Year Introduced etc. You have the option of searching
        for individual aircraft (either specific or random) and searching for the complete list of all aircraft. 
        The collected aircraft information will then be saved to a CSV file (spreadsheet / excel type of file) 
        within the same directory as this Aircraft Profiles executable file.
        
        Cheers!!!
